Close readings of literature by authors from the 1950s to the present day, such as Chinua Achebe, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, and Chimamanda Adichie unveil literary traditions, themes, and motifs specific to African writing. An examination of the writers' attention to topics such as (colonialism, ethnic war, gender oppression, migration, and Afropolitanism) allows for a critical analysis of the historical, social, and political issues on the African continent. The authors' discussions about globalization and its impact on African nations, particularly in relationship to the global marketplace, highlight the paradoxical nature of Africa's rich natural resources (oil, diamonds and coltan) against the continent's economic dependency on global investors. Postcolonialism, Feminism, and Psychoanalytic theory will enrich students' interpretation and analysis of the texts."

Bigfoot, Atlantis, and ancient astronauts remain common subjects in mainstream media, but what do we, and what can we, really know about such subjects? In this course we will assemble a basic toolkit for skeptical inquiry, and apply it to several examples of anthropological pseudoscience. Dissecting these cases leads to an investigation of how we can distinguish truth from falsehood, and knowable facts from unknowable conjectures. Lastly, we will try to understand the persistence of pseudoscience and other forms of nonsense in our culture, as these clearly thrive despite their lack of grounding in reality.'

Factors behind its ascent to the most popular art form as well as a lucrative medium of entertainment and potent vehicle for social change not only in India but also beyond its shores are examined in some depth. We discover how these various Indian cinemas address and depict the social mores, cultural practices and political issues of the South Asian subcontinent. Themes for our discussions include but are not limited to nationalism, sexuality, censorship, activism, tradition, modernity, identity, gender roles, and the pleasures and politics of song, dance and music, as we look at historical, thematic and aesthetic issues of these cinemas and their impact and influence in India as well as globally."

Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well."

It will challenge the application of current Western feminist standards to Japanese culture through the analysis of Japanese literary works. We will begin with Japanese mythology focusing on the stories of the creator goddess and Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the imperial line was descended. We will consider the great Heian Era women writers and their culture, examining the difference between men's and women's writing. From the Heian era we will move to the Meiji Era, when Japan's isolationist period had ended and centuries' worth of Western literature was introduced to Japan. We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style. The course will close with a focus how literature treats Japanese women in our own time. This course is offered as AAS 331 and WST 331."

        courseDescription: "This course examines Japanese literature of the Meiji era, an era unique in the history of the world. Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well."

We will study "empire" by analyzing narratives about the former colonies of Spain, France, Britain and the United States. As we discuss the metaphors or tropes of empire, we will also examine the concept of empire as a historical and contemporary formation, or what an empire meant in the 19th century and what it means today in the early 21st century. The course begins with the premise that travel narratives and modern visual culture illuminate the relationship between the violence and romance of travel. The course includes modern travel narratives (i.e. novels by Asian Americans) that focus on the lives of those who are forced to travel or migrate due to civil war, poverty and/or economic instability. This course is offered as AAS 305 and EGL 305.'

This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies. Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages--proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review--culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.

        courseDescription: 'From the 16th to the 19th century, Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans all contributed to new knowledge production in the Americas in the realms of natural history, medicine, and early science. Within various colonial contexts, the drive to find, collect, and, where possible, commodify native plants, animals, and peoples played critical roles in larger contests to control people and places. As competing imperial powers sought to exploit natural resources and reshape entire regions in the service of empire, Indians and enslaved Africans variously resisted or contributed to those efforts. This course explores how changing concepts of the natural world impacted the development of science, medicine, and technology and influenced concepts of race, gender, class, and human adaptability. Readings will include current works by historians and other scholars as well as primary documents¿ranging from fantastical early travel narratives, to revealing accounts of Indian and African American medical/spiritual practitioners, to increasingly empirical studies by surveyors, engineers, and scientists in the 19th century.'

What connected famous explorers like Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Christopher Columbus to people who traveled the globe as part of their daily lives as merchants, diplomats, and sailors? Travel was a central feature of the medieval world and one of the primary factors that contributed to cultural contact, communication, exchange, and the diffusion of ideas between Europe, Africa and Asia in the pre-modern era. This course will explore the interconnected histories of the medieval world, focusing primarily on the Mediterranean world¿Latin Christendom, Byzantium and the Islamic world¿between roughly 500 and 1700. It will also devote attention to travel and travelers in the Atlantic world (including West Africa), the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, and China during the same period. Whether the motivation was exploration, piety, knowledge, survival, or profit, the act of travel involved the travelers in larger processes of interaction and exchange between cultures. We will examine the lives and accounts of pilgrims, merchants, scholars, slaves, and soldiers to investigate what motivated people to travel to, from, or within regions throughout the medieval world, and how they portrayed their experiences. With an emphasis on primary sources and class discussion, we will explore the writings of a diverse group of travelers and situate them within their larger social, cultural, and political contexts, while at the same time coming to terms with their reasons for travel and their particular world view.'

Within various colonial contexts, the drive to find, collect, and, where possible, commodify native plants, animals, and peoples played critical roles in larger contests to control people and places. As competing imperial powers sought to exploit natural resources and reshape entire regions in the service of empire, Indians and enslaved Africans variously resisted or contributed to those efforts. This course explores how changing concepts of the natural world impacted the development of science, medicine, and technology and influenced concepts of race, gender, class, and human adaptability. Readings will include current works by historians and other scholars as well as primary documents¿ranging from fantastical early travel narratives, to revealing accounts of Indian and African American medical/spiritual practitioners, to increasingly empirical studies by surveyors, engineers, and scientists in the 19th century.'

What connected famous explorers like Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Christopher Columbus to people who traveled the globe as part of their daily lives as merchants, diplomats, and sailors? Travel was a central feature of the medieval world and one of the primary factors that contributed to cultural contact, communication, exchange, and the diffusion of ideas between Europe, Africa and Asia in the pre-modern era. This course will explore the interconnected histories of the medieval world, focusing primarily on the Mediterranean world¿Latin Christendom, Byzantium and the Islamic world¿between roughly 500 and 1700. It will also devote attention to travel and travelers in the Atlantic world (including West Africa), the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, and China during the same period. Whether the motivation was exploration, piety, knowledge, survival, or profit, the act of travel involved the travelers in larger processes of interaction and exchange between cultures. We will examine the lives and accounts of pilgrims, merchants, scholars, slaves, and soldiers to investigate what motivated people to travel to, from, or within regions throughout the medieval world, and how they portrayed their experiences. With an emphasis on primary sources and class discussion, we will explore the writings of a diverse group of travelers and situate them within their larger social, cultural, and political contexts, while at the same time coming to terms with their reasons for travel and their particular world view.'

Cultural revolutions, student protests, Cold War battles fought in the Third World and Eastern Europe, and the radicalization of civil rights struggles all converged. How do we make sense of the 1960s as a transnational, global set of experiences whose revolutionary heroes¿from Che Guevara to The Beatles¿and imagery were deeply intertwined? This course will examine various foundational texts from the period, including films, music and poster art, while exploring the multiple contexts of the ¿Global Sixties,¿ from Cuba to Prague, Paris to Berkeley, Beijing to Mexico City.'

It will challenge the application of current Western feminist standards to Japanese culture through the analysis of Japanese literary works. We will begin with Japanese mythology focusing on the stories of the creator goddess and Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the imperial line was descended. We will consider the great Heian Era women writers and their culture, examining the difference between men's and women's writing. From the Heian era we will move to the Meiji Era, when Japan's isolationist period had ended and centuries' worth of Western literature was introduced to Japan. We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style. The course will close with a focus how literature treats Japanese women in our own time. This course is offered as AAS 331 and WST 331."

        courseDescription: "This course examines Japanese literature of the Meiji era, an era unique in the history of the world. Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well."

Few people will ever witness a journalist in action.

This class explores how the journalists' representations in the media contribute to public perceptions about them, and explores the trajectory of these perceptions from the days of silent films through the 21st century."

        courseDescription: 'A historical and socio-communicational exploration of the genres and styles of journalism emerging and shaping the different regions of the Global South since the early mercantile expansion of the 17th century and into the 21st century. In parallel with the colonial push into the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, journalistic narratives start to shape the Western view of the new worlds. But the process has a dual nature: these styles and genres are appropriated, re-signified and repurposed locally, giving birth to an array of journalisms that do not conform with their Western counterparts. Crónicas, corridos, roman feuilleton, and a vast number of other forms of journalisms born in the Global South are discussed during this course. The class aims at expanding the Western idea of journalism as the watchdog of democracy, and to understanding journalism in the Global South in its historical context, within its political, pedagogical and literary roles.'

Factors behind its ascent to the most popular art form as well as a lucrative medium of entertainment and potent vehicle for social change not only in India but also beyond its shores are examined in some depth. We discover how these various Indian cinemas address and depict the social mores, cultural practices and political issues of the South Asian subcontinent. Themes for our discussions include but are not limited to nationalism, sexuality, censorship, activism, tradition, modernity, identity, gender roles, and the pleasures and politics of song, dance and music, as we look at historical, thematic and aesthetic issues of these cinemas and their impact and influence in India as well as globally."

We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style.

        courseDescription: "This course examines Japanese literature of the Meiji era, an era unique in the history of the world. Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well."

In the past few decades we have started to recognize how the loss of these species has caused substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystem diversity and function, mediated by changes in prey population dynamics and behavior. It is only recently that we have realized that changes in the abundance of apex predators in the ocean (e.g., sharks, marine mammals, tuna and other large predatory bony fish) may be causing similar changes in coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems. In this course we will (1) review the biology of key marine apex predators, (2) explore how 'top down' processes (predation and intimidation of prey) can influence marine ecosystems and (3) review the status of marine apex predators and how this relates to the current state of ocean ecosystems. We will draw from the primary literature, from both the terrestrial and marine realms, and host outside speakers who study these animals in the field."

It is only recently that we have realized that changes in the abundance of apex predators in the ocean (e.g., sharks, marine mammals, tuna and other large predatory bony fish) may be causing similar changes in coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems. In this course we will (1) review the biology of key marine apex predators, (2) explore how 'top down' processes (predation and intimidation of prey) can influence marine ecosystems and (3) review the status of marine apex predators and how this relates to the current state of ocean ecosystems.

The engagement of living subjects can illuminate music and musical practice from all times and places. And yet, ethnographic methods are not easily defined, no less learned. The challenges of writing human lives compels us to think ethically, legally, interpersonally, philosophically, often all at once. This course asks students to read extensively in the history of ethnography, reflecting on its key arguments and genealogies.'

        courseDescription: "Examines the intersection of music, sound, and political life. 'Politics' is considered broadly, in domains ranging from electoral campaigns to the often fragile relationships between neighbors or lovers. The course considers how sound, hearing, and listening are implicated in the political dimensions of social life. We consider how our political lives are full of listening--to speeches, debates, music, and sound, and how (for example) issues of noise, headphone use, musical taste, and racialized sound have an intrinsic political dimension. The course will focus on musics from diverse global contexts, as well as non-musical sounds."

We discover how these various Indian cinemas address and depict the social mores, cultural practices and political issues of the South Asian subcontinent. Themes for our discussions include but are not limited to nationalism, sexuality, censorship, activism, tradition, modernity, identity, gender roles, and the pleasures and politics of song, dance and music, as we look at historical, thematic and aesthetic issues of these cinemas and their impact and influence in India as well as globally."

        courseDescription: "This course examines both writings of Japanese women and writings about Japanese women. It will challenge the application of current Western feminist standards to Japanese culture through the analysis of Japanese literary works. We will begin with Japanese mythology focusing on the stories of the creator goddess and Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the imperial line was descended. We will consider the great Heian Era women writers and their culture, examining the difference between men's and women's writing. From the Heian era we will move to the Meiji Era, when Japan's isolationist period had ended and centuries' worth of Western literature was introduced to Japan. We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style. The course will close with a focus how literature treats Japanese women in our own time. This course is offered as AAS 331 and WST 331."

        courseDescription: "This course examines Japanese literature of the Meiji era, an era unique in the history of the world. Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well."

While learning to gather information and to apply ethical principles in a logical, persuasive fashion, students will explore and write about various types of evidence concerning the health care needs of different populations: a field research project on a health issue affecting a local target population of their choice, a critique of government documents that contain data on that issue and population, and a review of scholarly research on the same issue as it affects the larger national population represented by that local one. Writing assignments will include drafts and final versions of a research proposal, field research results, numerical analysis, literature review and a final project incorporating all of the previous work conducted about that issue and population. Students will also write a reflective paper which can serve as the basis for a personal statement for medical or other health-related graduate school applications.

        courseDescription: 'Good research skills are critical to academic success. Most disciplines require writing based upon research, as arguments and explanations make little impact on audiences without effective supporting evidence, drawn from relevant scholarship on the subject. This involves knowing how to use appropriate databases, source materials, and composing processes, as well as negotiating the values, genres, and languages of the scholarly communities in which one is researching. In this course, students will learn fundamentals of research methods, practice these methods in a series of integrated research and writing assignments, and engage in critical reflection about research and writing. Students will focus on an area of disciplinary interest to them, and practice these essential research and writing skills through a series of projects: library assignments, research log, research proposal, annotated bibliography, literature review, abstract, research paper and reflection paper.'

Whenever we don't quite like someone else's idea and we want him or her to come closer to ours, argumentative writing is the most efficient method for such persuasion, in whatever profession you're considering. This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies. Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages--proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review--culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration. This course will fulfill the second half of the Writing Pre-Med/Pre-Health prerequisite. This course is offered as both EGL 381 and WRT 381."
